# SQL Projects

This repository contains the schema for an SQL database designed to manage information about pilgrimages, events associated with those pilgrimages, and user reviews.

# Tables
The database consists of three main tables:

- pilgrimage: Stores information about specific pilgrimages, including location, description, and other relevant details.
- events: Captures details about events happening during a pilgrimage, such as dates, locations, and descriptions.
- reviews: Holds user reviews for both pilgrimages and events, including rating, text content.
